# Welcome to the HowTos wiki!

## This wiki is maintained by the whole lab, please make changes/updates if you see incorrect or outdated information.

You will be able to see at the top of the page when the most recent revision was and who edited it. If something is not working or does not make sense, you can ask them. If the most recent revision was a while ago, you may need to ask around for help then _update the page once you figure out how to correct it_.


## Searching:

The search bar on the right hand side will search on page titles so if you remember that a page exists and need a link that might be useful.
